# UWASN-GeneticRouting
This project implements a genetic algorithm-based routing optimization for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UWASN). It enhances energy efficiency, reduces propagation delays, and improves data transmission reliability by dynamically clustering nodes and optimizing routes.
